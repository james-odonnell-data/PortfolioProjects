# Data Analysis Projects
 
Hi, I'm James!  I have B.S. of Finance from George Mason University.  Since graduating I have held various roles in various industries including launching a small profitable business.  Most recently I was a Senior Manager at a company in the hospitality industry that boasts 9 consecutive years on Fortuneâ€™s Best 100 Companies to Work For, ranking as high as 25th and oftentimes being the only hospitality company on that list.  I discovered Data Analytics while spending time abroad with my immediate family during a planned career break, I immediately knew that my future would be in analytics.  A common denominator that has always been a key part of my success across all roles has been a 'numbers first', objective, and analytical approach to business problems.  I have spent the last few months upskilling, studying, and practicing to gain the technical skills needed.  

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics and related topics.
