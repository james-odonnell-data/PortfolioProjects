# Data Analysis Projects
 
Hi, I'm James!  I have B.S. of Finance from George Mason University.  Since graduating I have held various roles in various industries including launching a small profitable writing business.  Most recently I was a Senior Manager at a company in the hospitality industry that boasts 9 consecutive years on Fortuneâ€™s Best 100 Companies to Work For, ranking as high as 25th and oftentimes being the only hospitality company on the list.  I discovered Data Analytics while spending time abroad with my immediate family during a planned career break, I instantly knew that my future would be in analytics.  A common denominator that has always been a key part of my success across all roles I hve held has been a 'numbers first', objective, and analytical approach to business problems.  I spent months putting myself through a self-learned 'bootcamp' upskilling, studying, and practicing to gain the technical skills needed.  

This is a repository to showcase the skills I have gained,share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics.
